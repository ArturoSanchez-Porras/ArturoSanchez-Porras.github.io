	</h1>
	
<p>
 As mentioned prevously, my name is Arturo Sanchez. Some of the talents or knowledge that I have is basic mechanical knowledge. I am also know my way around power tools. Throughout my career in the California Cadet Corps, I was able to develop my leadership skills along with my teaching skills. For previouse experience with programming and artificial intellegence, I have robotics within Botball. This is going to be my fifth year of being on the robotics team and competing in the global competition, GCER. My part on the team is that of lead builder, but I do have knowledge of programing with C++.
