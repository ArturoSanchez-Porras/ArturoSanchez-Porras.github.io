US Trivia Android App
Created by: Ezel Wilson, Arturo Sanchez

</p>

<p>
  The creation of  “US Trivia”  went by real smoothly. Ezel is a very knowledgeable and experienced programmer that explained to me how the program works. This made me capable of changing, alternating and adding different parts of the quiz. The only thing that we did have complications with was figuring how to organize the horizontal and vertical arrangements. We would put them one way then another and when we ran it on the phone, it would not line up how it would on app inventor. We overcame that issue by just starting over and erasing the arrangements. Another issue that we had was pushing the program up to GitHub. It would not work, we would double check all of the steps to make sure everything was spot on and nothing worked. The solution to this problem was to ask Mr. Landfried for help and he clarified the issue which was just a misplaced period. One thing that I accomplished independently was add questions and answers. An opportunity for improvement was when we figured out that we could use a procedure to shorten up the program, thus, making it more efficient and easier to program. After Ezel explained how the program worked, I was able to go through and add questions, answers and choices.

<p>
  Here at the beginning of the video you see the Home Screen. As the game loads, you see a notification appear on the Screen. It reads, “Find out if you are a true AMERICAN!”. When the notification disappears, you will see two buttons. One reads “Start” and the other “About”. We’ll click on “Start” first. As we breeze through the questions, you will notice that they aren't overly complicated. Yet some users will wish that they had payed more attention in History class. All of the questions are set up as follows, if you get the answer correct, your selection will change to the color of green and a little “ding” sound will play. If you get the question incorrect, your selection will change to the color of red and a buzzer will sound. After you answer every question, a “Next” button will appear at the bottom of the screen. To proceed to the following question, you will need to click this button. The “Exit” button is available throughout all of the questions. After you complete all of the questions, a screen will pop up. This screen shows you your score out of fifteenth and the options of “Home” or “About”. Lets click “About”. On the “About” screen you see the names of the developers of the app as well as an iconic and renowned patriotic background.

	<p>Johnny Boy<p>
    
</p>

There once was a boy named Johnny. Johnny lived in a small country town in Georgia. If something ever happened, everyone would know within that same day. One day a recruiter came to the town to recruit any willing men that would like to join. One of his buddies told Johnny about the recruiter that was in town. He told Johnny about the offer that he had gotten and about how he was now enlisted. Johnny was now curious. His mother told him not to go downtown. She had heard that the Marine Corps. Rectruitar was hanging around. Johnny was known for not paying attention. Susie told Johnny go serve your nation. He took a cab down to the MEP’s station.  Johnny wanted to hear what recruiter had to say. He offered Johnny job security and free education. Johnny decided that it was a great deal. He got his bags and was ready to go. Susie was in the bedroom and Jody was the window. They all saw when Johnny stepped onto that Greyhound bus. What they didn't know was that now came the bends and thrust. Once at camp, the drill instructors trained him rough and hard. They taught him how to fight and how to march. The weeks were short but long they seemed. Soon Johnny had earned the title marine. He had survived just like rest of them. Now his family was proud to call him a marine.
